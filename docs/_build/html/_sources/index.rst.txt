Te_HF_Conversion
================================

Te_HF_Conversion is a simple code that allows to convert the elastic thickness of the lithosphere to planetary heat flow given several input parameters, including crustal thickness, strain rate, or radiogenic heating. The model makes use of the equating bending moment approach of `McNutt (1984) <https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/JB089iB13p11180>`_ and has been used in `Broquet et al (2020) <https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2019GL086746>`_.

Te_HF_Conversion
================================

Te_HF_Conversion is a simple code that allows to:

(1) Convert the elastic thickness of the lithosphere to planetary heat flow (and a yield strength envelope) given several input parameters including crustal thickness, strain rate, or radiogenic heating.

(2) Retrieve the elastic thickness (and a yield strength envelope) of the lithosphere based on a temperature profile. 

The model makes use of the equating bending moment approach of `McNutt (1984) <https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/JB089iB13p11180>`_ and has been used in `Broquet et al (2020) <https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2019GL086746>`_.
